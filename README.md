# SmartSlam
Door "slam" sound recognizer using neural networks and RaspberryPi

Idea : "when someone familiar accesses your home it is usually possible to recognize him/her by the sounds produced. 
Can it be done by a machine too?"

## Overview

Devices:
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B (OS: Raspbian GNU/Linux 8.0 jessie)
- High sensitive environmental MONO microphone
- PIR (Passive InfraRed) motion sensor

The PIR sensor placed outside the door is the recording trigger.

Sound recording, fixed to 30sec, is performed near door entrance at a sample rate of 48000 Hz.

The majority of captured file has been manually labelled to train a **Convolutional Neural Network** using
[Google TensorFlow framework](https://www.tensorflow.org/); 
Training is the only operation performed outside the Raspberry because of computational power limits. 
Once trained, a file containing the resulting model has been put into the Raspberry to make on-device prediction.
The model generated recognize this 8 sound category: 
Nobody (just people passing outside the door), 
Exit (someone exit house), 
Bell (someone ring the bell),
Person 1-5 (test house people).
Overall accuracy reach ~60%, rising to ~80% if we consider all the people as a single category.

A [Telegram chat bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots) is used to instantly notify users of new accesses 
(*timestamp*,*classification* and *audio file*), 
while through a webUI ([flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)) permits to consultâ€‹ the accesses log and refine the classifications done.
